            <p>Hello World! Welcome to my first official website since enrolling in DU's Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>The decision to enroll in bootcamp has completely turned my life upsdie down.
            <p>I used to work for a retail company; managing 40+ employees, executing unique brand launches, and integrating new technology into everyday workflow. </p>
            <p>Coding already feels like a better fit... I look forward to a new life behind my computer screen. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me, and I plan on having a great time learning along the way.</p>
